# **Planning for the Next 10 Years**

With the rise of AI, machines are expected to become cognitively more capable than humans in the next **3–5 years**. That may sound pessimistic—but it's likely close to reality. As that happens, humans will need to focus on what makes them uniquely human—**traits that cannot be replicated by machines**:

1. *Emotions and love* for our species  
2. *Wanderlust*—the drive to travel the world and beyond  
3. *Desire for immortality*—to live and stay young forever  
4. *Pursuit of maximum human potential and greatness*

## **Man vs. Machine**

With technologies like Neuralink, **could some humans become as powerful as machines?**

The core limitation of humans is that acquiring new skills requires time, practice, and a brain with limited capacity—it cannot be *horizontally scaled* like compute systems. On the other hand, AI only needs:

- Data
- Compute
- Instructions

AI will massively enhance the **production** side of things. But what about **consumption**?

## **The Coming Divide: Production vs. Consumption**

As AI boosts production, society will likely face **a dramatic imbalance in wealth distribution**. Those who possess:

- Capital
- Technology
- AI leverage

...could become **100x to 1,000,000x more productive**, gaining an unmatchable edge over those who don't.

For the economy to function, **consumption must also rise**—but who will consume? Likely the top 1% who will have wealth equivalent to the bottom 99%. These ultra-wealthy individuals may engage in previously unimaginable activities like:

- Vacations on Mars or **space stations**  
- deep-sea exploration  
- gene editing to become superhuman  
- Extended lifespans and freedom from diseases

They will own AI systems that generate wealth for them, granting access to these adventures.

Meanwhile, those left behind may:

- Lag in education and healthcare  
- Struggle to access capital  
- Live lives closer to mere survival—**eat, sleep, reproduce**, relying heavily on governments for food and shelter  

Yes, these views are **extreme**—but it’s **already happening**.

## **What Can You Do to Prepare?**

**Own the systems that define the future.** But how?

- *Build something yourself*
- Or *own equity* in transformative technologies

# **What Will the Next 5 Years Look Like?**

Assuming a free market continues to exist, we might see:

1. All devices become smart—they’ll see, talk, hear, and analyze.  
2. Less human involvement in day-to-day systems.  
3. Money will be forced to go to work—fueling human leisure and extreme exploration. Areas like Mars, deep oceans, Antarctica, and space tourism will grow.  
4. Nuclear energy may become widely adopted, leading to an abundance of clean energy, enabling more travel, activity, and energy consumption.  
5. Rich humans start becoming superhumans via:
   - Exotic plastic surgeries  
   - Gene editing for superior traits  
   - Access to elite healthcare and anti-aging solutions  
6. More appreciation of human abilities—sports, concerts, and physical experiences will boom.  
7. Robots and software will handle most hard and soft tasks.  
8. Birth rates may decline  
9. Aging populations will grow, demanding advanced health and caregiving systems  
10. People will accumulate more: clothes, wearables, smart home gadgets, vehicles, etc.

## **What Skills Will Matter Most?**

To thrive in this new world, skill up in the following areas:

1. *Leadership and persuasion*  
   - The ability to influence people will be invaluable.  
2. *Politics*
   - A largely untapped domain. As taxes rise (possibly reaching 20% of total income), policy influence will become more powerful.  
3. *AI product building*
   - It may *look* trivial, but crafting sophisticated tools with AI integration is a major opportunity.  
   - This aligns closely with what I'm currently doing.  
4. *Invest in hard assets*
   - Real estate may remain a stable long-term store of value.

### *Closing Thoughts*

The next 10 years will not just be a time of change—they’ll be a *complete transformation* of how we live, work, and think. The key question is: *How will you participate in shaping that future?*
